**Write production-ready smart contracts for Ethereum blockchain with Solidity**

## What is this book about?
Solidity is among the most popular and contract-oriented programming languages used for writing decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum blockchain. If you’re looking to perfect your skills in writing professional-grade smart contracts using Solidity, this book can help.

You will get started with a detailed introduction to blockchain, smart contracts, and Ethereum, while also gaining useful insights into the Solidity programming language. A dedicated section will then take you through the different Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) standards, including ERC-20, ERC-223, and ERC-721, and demonstrate how you can choose among these standards while writing smart contracts. As you approach later chapters, you will cover the different smart contracts available for use in libraries such as OpenZeppelin. You’ll also learn to use different open source tools to test, review and improve the quality of your code and make it production-ready. Toward the end of this book, you’ll get to grips with techniques such as adding security to smart contracts, and gain insights into various security considerations. 

By the end of this book, you will have the skills you need to write secure, production-ready smart contracts in Solidity from scratch for decentralized applications on Ethereum blockchain.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Test and debug smart contracts with Truffle, Ganache, Remix, and MetaMask
* Gain insights into maintaining code quality with different tools
* Get up to speed with ERC standards such as ERC-20 and ERC-721
* Become adept at using design patterns while writing smart contracts
* Use MultiSignature (MultiSig) wallets and improve the security of contracts
* Use Oracle services to fetch information from outside the blockchain

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
contract VariableStorage {
uint storeUint; //uint256 storage variable
//...
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for developers and data scientists who want to learn Ethereum, blockchain, and Solidity to write smart contracts and develop production-ready code. Basic knowledge of Solidity is assumed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).
